# Students Management Web Application

The Students Management Web Application is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage student records, courses, enrollments, and generate reports. With this application, users can easily register new students, add courses, enroll students in courses, generate various reports, and perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student and course records.


## Project Overview

This application is built using the Flask framework for the backend, React for the frontend, and leverages technologies such as Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, and SQLAlchemy-Serializer for database management. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing student and course data efficiently.
